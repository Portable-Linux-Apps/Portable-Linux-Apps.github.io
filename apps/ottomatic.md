# OTTOMATIC

 The year is 1957 and a fleet of flying saucers from Planet X have come to 
 Earth. These saucers are under the control of the evil Brain Aliens who 
 are abducting helpless human beings to become slaves of The Giant Brain.
 
 You are Otto Matic, the robot who is given the job of saving Earth from the
 clutches of The Giant Brain from Planet X. You must rescue as many humans 
 as you can while defeating the Brain Aliens and all of their evil followers.
 
 Your mission will take you to strange and fantastic alien worlds which are 
 often treacherous and will require Otto to perform amazing feats.
