# SOIL-EDITOR

 CRITERIA 1D is a one-dimensional agro-hydrological model. It includes soil 
 water fluxes, crop development and water needs, a GIS interface (CRITERIA 
 GEO) for geographical simulations and tools to manage crop and soil 
 parameters. 
 
 The software is written in C++ using Qt libraries, so cross-platform 
 building is possible (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
 
 Soil editor is a tool to edit the soil properties. It uses a modified Van 
 Genuchten - Mualem model to estimate the water retention and hydraulic c
 onductivity curves.
