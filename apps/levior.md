# LEVIOR

 levior (latin word meaning lighter) is a web (HTTP/HTTPs) to Gemini proxy.
 
 It converts web pages on-the-fly to the gemtext format, allowing you to browse 
 regular web pages with any Gemini browser without having to suffer the 
 heavyness associated with certain technologies of the modern web.
 
 levior can either run as a gemini server with special "endpoints" that
 will render the requested web page as gemtext and rewrite gemini URLs to be
 routed through the levior service (this mode will work with all gemini 
 browsers), or as a transparent http proxy that renders the web pages as 
 gemtext without rewriting URLs (in this mode you will need to use a Gemini 
 browser that supports using proxies).
