# KAJONGG

 Kajongg is the ancient Chinese board game for 4 players. Kajongg can be used 
 in two different ways: Scoring a manual game where you play as always and use 
 Kajongg for the computation of scores and for bookkeeping. Or you can use 
 Kajongg to play against any combination of other human players or computer 
 players.
