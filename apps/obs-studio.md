# OBS-STUDIO

 OBS Studio is a free and open source software for video recording and live  streaming.
 
 High performance real time video/audio capturing and mixing. Create scenes  made up of multiple sources including window captures, images, text, browser  windows, webcams, capture cards and more.
 
 This script lets you choose between:
 - the unofficial AppImage that also works on musl systems
 - the Archimage (AppImage based on JuNest, Arch Linux) which includes libcef and therefore browser support
 - the same Archimage without libcef, and therefore about 100 MB smaller

 These are all unofficial builds. And they all work on older distributions too.
