# TESTDISK

 This installation script provides TestDisk & PhotoRec.
 
 TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed 
 to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again 
 when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses 
 or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition 
 table recovery using TestDisk is really easy. TestDisk can:
 - Fix partition table, recover deleted partition
 - Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup
 - Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector
 - Fix FAT tables
 - Rebuild NTFS boot sector
 - Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup
 - Fix MFT using MFT mirror
 - Locate ext2/ext3/ext4 Backup SuperBlock
 - Undelete files from FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystem
 - Copy files from deleted FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions.

 PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files 
 including video, documents and archives from hard disks (Mechanical Hard 
 drives, Solid State Drives...), CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo 
 Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system 
 and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your 
 media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.
