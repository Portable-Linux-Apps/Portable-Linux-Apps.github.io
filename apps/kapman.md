# KAPMAN

 Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man. You must go through the  levels escaping ghosts in a maze. You lose a life when a ghost eats you,  but you can eat the ghosts for a few seconds when eating an energizer.  You win points when eating pills, energizers, and bonus, and you win one  life for each 10,000 points. When you have eaten all the pills and  energizers of a level, you go to the next level, and the player and ghost  speeds increase.
