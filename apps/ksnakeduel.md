# KSNAKEDUEL

 Snake race game. The object of the game is to avoid running into walls, your own tail, and that of your opponent, while at the same time you have to try  to get your opponent to run into them.
 
 It also includes kdesnake, a special mode of the game where you can play the  classical snake action game. In snake you steer a snake which has to eat food. While eating, the snake grows. But once a player collides with the other  snake or  the wall, the game is lost. This becomes, of course, more and more difficult the longer the snakes grow.
 
 This game is part of the KDE Games suite.
