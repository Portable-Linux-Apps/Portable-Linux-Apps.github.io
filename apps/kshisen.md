# KSHISEN

 Similar to Mahjongg, except the tiles are not stacked on
 top of one another. Find a tile's pair to remove them from
 the board.
 
 NOTE: this script includes icons and launchers for the 
 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
