 with wires by rotating these elements around. Use as few
 rotations as possible.

 This game require "org.kde.games.core" to work. 
 On Debian based systems it is sufficient to install the 
 "qml-module-org-kde-games-core" package from the main
 repositories to solve this issue.

 full KDE games suite in just one Appimage (takes 280 MB).
