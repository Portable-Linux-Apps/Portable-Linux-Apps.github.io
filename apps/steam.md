# STEAM

 Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve.
 
 It  was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003  as a 
 way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded 
 to include games from third-party publishers.
 
 Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital 
 storefront. Steam offers digital rights management (DRM), server hosting, 
 video streaming, and social networking services.
 
 It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of 
 games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud 
 storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality. 
 
 This is the Unofficial AppImage built on top of "Conty" (Arch Linux).
 
 It includes 32-bit libraries, gamescope, gamemode and mangohud.
 
 It can also install Nvidia drivers locally, if needed.
