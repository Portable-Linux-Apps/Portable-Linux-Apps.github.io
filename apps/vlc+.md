# VLC+

 VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework
 that plays most multimedia files as  well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and 
 various streaming  protocols. 
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight 
 Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro. This kind
 of AppImage runs on any GNU/Linux distro old or newer, with at least the 
 Linux kernel 3+.

 VLC+ is the stable version but with additional and/or experimental features.
 
 Support for JAVA (jre8-openjdk package) is included and is open to new
 feature implementations (for example, third-party plugins).
