#GAPHOR

 Gaphor is a UML and SysML modeling application written in Python. It is 
 designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements 
 a fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture 
 drawing tool. 
 
 You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as 
 well as create complete, highly complex models.
