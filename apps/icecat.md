# ICECAT

 GNU IceCat is the GNU version of the Firefox browser.
 
 Its main advantage is an ethical one: it is entirely free software. While the Firefox source code from the Mozilla project is free software, they distribute and recommend nonfree software as plug-ins and addons. Also their trademark license imposes requirements for the distribution of modified versions that make it inconvenient to exercise freedom 3.

 This is the portable official version converted to an AppImage by our team, "Portable Linux Apps" , no additional changes have been made.
