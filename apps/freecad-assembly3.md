# FREECAD-ASSEMBLY3

 Official source code of FreeCAD, a free and opensource multiplatform 3D parametric modeler.
 
 Assembly3 is an external workbench that is used to perform assembly of different bodies contained in a single file or in multiple documents. The workbench is based on several core function changes done for the version of FreeCAD 0.19 (e.g. App Link), so the Assembly3 Workbench can not be used with earlier versions.
