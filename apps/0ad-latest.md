# 0AD-LATEST

 0 A.D. (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) is a free, open-source, historical
 Real Time Strategy (RTS) game currently under development by Wildfire
 Games, a global group of volunteer game developers. As the leader of
 an ancient civilization, you must gather the resources you need to 
 raise a military force and dominate your enemies.
 
 This is the AppImage built from source of the latest development build.

 NOTE: If you have a GPU that has a chipset other than Nvidia, the 
 Vulkan backend may be automatically disabled in some cases. This 
 versione is based on the latest Ubuntu LTS, so it should not work on 
 older distros. In case of problems, install "0ad" instead.
