# VIVALDI-SNAPSHOT

 Vivaldi is an advanced chromium-based web browser made with the power user
 in mind. Desktop Snapshots are work-in-progress builds that are available 
 for anyone to download and test.
 
 NOTE: This database provides an install script for aarch64 (which only 
 extracts the official deb package for ARM) and one for x84_64 (which points 
 to the unofficial AppImage package built from the official deb package for 
 amd64/64bit).
