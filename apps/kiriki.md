 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a
 lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of 
 disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic 
 GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
