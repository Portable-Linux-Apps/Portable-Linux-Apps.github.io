# AFFINITY

 Affinity is a suite of professional graphic design, photo editing, and desktop publishing software. It's a common alternative to software from the Adobe Suite such as for Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign.

 The installer automatically sets up Wine (a compatibility layer for running Windows applications) with all necessary configurations, dependencies, and optimizations.
