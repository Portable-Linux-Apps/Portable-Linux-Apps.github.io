 An educational and fun game based around molecular geometry. Form the 
 resemblance of a molecule by sliding atoms around. 
 
 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a
 lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of 
 disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic 
 GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.

           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
