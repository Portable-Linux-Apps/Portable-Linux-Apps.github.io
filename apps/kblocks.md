# KBLOCKS

 KBlocks is the classic falling blocks game. The idea is to stack the falling  blocks to create horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed  it is removed, and more space is available in the play area. When there is  not enough space for blocks to fall, the game is over.
 
 This game is part of the KDE Games suite.
