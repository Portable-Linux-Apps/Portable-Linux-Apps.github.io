# GAMEIMAGE

 AppImage Game Packer.
 
 Game emulation is on the rise, with years of contribution from the community
 and now with Valve's portable handheld, the steam deck. The fragmentation
 with several platform emulators is daunting, especially since it requires 
 repetitive configuration for the first time or if the config files go missing.
 
 GameImage is a tool to pack a runner (such as an emulator), a game, and it's
 configs in a single appimage package.
 
 Advantages:
 
 - Simplicity, no need to install an emulator or wine to run your games, they
 are downloaded as appimages and packaged with the game.
 - Each game config/saves are in the same folder as the appimage by default 
 (it can be changed to use global ~/.config). Which simplifies backups.
 - Usability, get your game running with a double click on a fresh linux 
 install, no dependencies required.
 - Storage, Smaller file sizes than loose files, since appimage uses squashfs.
