# FILELIGHT
 
 Filelight allows you to understand your disk usage by graphically 
 representing your filesystem as a set of concentric, segmented rings.
 
 It is like a pie-chart, but the segments nest, allowing you to see 
 both which directories take up all your space, and which directories 
 and files inside those directories are the real culprits. 
 
 This tool is part of the KDE Utils Suite.
