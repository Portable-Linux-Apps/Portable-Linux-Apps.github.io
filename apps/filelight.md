# FILELIGHT
 
 Filelight allows you to understand your disk usage by graphically representing your filesystem as a set of concentric, segmented rings.
 
 It is like a pie-chart, but the segments nest, allowing you to see  both which directories take up all your space, and which directories  and files inside those directories are the real culprits.

 This is the unofficial AppImage
