# KILLBOTS

 killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. The robots are numerous  and their sole objective is to destroy you. Fortunately for you, their  creator has focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result the  robots are severely lacking in intelligence. Your superior wit and a fancy  teleportation device are your only weapons against the never-ending stream  of mindless automatons.
