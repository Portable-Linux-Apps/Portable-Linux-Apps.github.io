# PIKA-BACKUP

 ### Keep your data safe

Doing backups the easy way. Plugin your USB drive and let the Pika do the rest for you.

<ul>
      <li>Create backups locally and remotely</li>
      <li>Set a schedule for regular backups</li>
      <li>Save time and disk space because Pika Backup does not need to copy known data again</li>
      <li>Encrypt your backups</li>
      <li>List created archives and browse through their contents</li>
      <li>Recover files or folders via your file browser</li>
</ul>

Pika Backup is designed to save your personal data and does not support complete system recovery. Pika Backup is powered by the well-tested BorgBackup software.
