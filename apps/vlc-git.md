# VLC-GIT

 VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework
 that plays most multimedia files as  well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and 
 various streaming  protocols. 
 
 This is the unstable build from the development branch.
 
 This is pre-built using the "vlc-git" package from ChaoticAUR.
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight 
 Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro.
