# FLARE

 Flare is a single-player 2D action RPG with fast-paced action and a dark 
 fantasy style.
 
 It is built on the FLARE engine (Free/Libre Action Roleplaying Engine). 
 
 Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the 
 game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats 
 are preferred (png, ogg). Maps are edited using Tiled.
 
 For best results, please use the latest version of the FLARE engine with 
 the game data in this repository. Using an older version of the engine 
 could result in some game elements not working correctly.
