# QMASTERPASSWORD

 qMasterPassword is a password manager based on Qt. Access all your 
 passwords using only a single master password. But in contrast to 
 other managers it does not store any passwords: Unique passwords 
 are generated from the master password and a site name. 
 
 This means you automatically get different passwords for each 
 account and there is no password file that can be lost or get 
 stolen. There is also no need to trust any online password 
 service.
