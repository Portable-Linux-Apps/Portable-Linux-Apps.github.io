# KJUMPINGCUBE

 Conquer all squares on a board either by occupying an empty square or 
 conquering your opponent's. A maxed out square will distribute its points 
 around it, causing empty squares to be occupied. Watch out for chain 
 reactions! 
 
 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a
 lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of 
 disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic 
 GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
