### Testing

To test changes to the website before pushing or while working on a pull
request:

</div>

* [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* In a terminal, change to the repository root directory
* run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You will see messages that confirm that site has generated and the server is
running. Then in your browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to confirm
the changes you made are what you expected. Error messages will appear in the
terminal window from where you ran Jekyll. When you change a file, the site
will rebuild automatically (it will take a few moments and you'll be informed
in the terminal when it's done). However, if you change '_config.yml', you
must kill Jekyll with ctrl-c and run it again to test the change.
